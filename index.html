        <img class="bat" src="img/bat.jpg" alt="bat" /><span class="bat-info"><h2>Hawaiian Hoary Bat Population: 1000</h2><p>The Hawaiian hoary bat is also called the 'ope'ape'a and is a subspecies of the North American hoary bat. It weighs five to eight ounces and has a wing span of 10.5 to 13.5 inches. It has a heavy, brown and gray fur coat, and its ears are tinged with white, giving it a frosted or “hoary” look. The Hawaiian hoary bat is the only native mammal species of Hawaii. Females are larger than males.</p>
        <p>The Hawaiian hoary bat prefers a solitary life and typically leaves its roost just before the sun sets and returns before the sun rises. It prefers to feed on insects flying over streams, bays, or along the seacoast, and it can eat up to 40% of its own body weight in a single feeding. Little is known about its reproductive behavior, but females have been known to give birth to twins during the summer months.</p>
        <p>The current population is unknown. Causes of decline include habitat loss, pesticides, predation, and roost disturbance. The US FWS has developed a research and recovery program to learn more about the species and to restore a healthy population.</p></span>

        <img id="cat" src="img/cat.jpg" alt="cat" /><span class="cat-info"><h2>Little Spotted Cat Population: 3000</h2><p>The little spotted cat is a wild cat species found in South America. It is the smallest of the three cats in its genus Leopardus, which includes the ocelot and the margay. Adults weigh only 4 to 8 lbs on average and can only reach up to 25.5 inches long. The tail can reach up to 13 inches long. Males are slightly larger than females. Their coats are typically tan to tawny in color and marked with black-blotchy spots, and there are black rings on the tail. There are also pale markings appearing on the face. The back of the ears are black with a white spot, the fur is thick, soft, and short, and the underparts are white. Although adults have a small frame, they are excellent climbers and hunters.</p>
        <p>This species is found in subtropical, humid evergreen and mountain cloud forests. They have also been reported in semi-arid thorn scrub in northeastern Brazil, dry deciduous forests in Venezuela, and also abandoned eucalyptus plantations. They are not commonly seen, and it is believed that they are nocturnal and solitary. Males are territorial and patrol boundaries, and they are even aggressive toward females. Diet consists of small rodents, birds, insects, and reptiles. They have also been observed eating small primates in Brazil. The reproductive behavior of this species is only known through the study of mating pairs in captivity. Females give birth to one to two kittens after a gestation period of 74 to 78 days.</p>
        <p>This species is threatened with extinction due to hunting for its fur and deforestation. It is legally protected in several countries, but in others, hunting is still allowed. The habitat of the species is commonly used for coffee plantations, but sightings in deforested areas and abandoned plantations suggest an ability to adjust to human disturbance.</p></span>

        <img id="cheetah"src="img/cheetah.jpg" alt="cheetah" /><span class="cheetah-info"><h2>Cheetah Population: 7500</h2><p>The cheetah has a wide range and is found from Africa south of the Sahara to India. It is considered the world's fastest mammal on land reaching speeds of up to 75 mph. Adults can reach up to 5 feet long and weigh up to 145 lbs. The tail can grow to be as long as 32 inches. It has a tawny brown coat with black spots, and black tear streaks across its cheeks, and its underparts are white. Unlike other cats, the cheetah prefers to chase down its prey rather than ambush them. They are also able to climb trees.</p>
        <p>Cheetahs prefer savanna and arid, open grasslands with available bushland (to hide when stalking prey) for their habitat. They prey on all sorts of mammals including gazelles, impala, wildebeest, and antelopes, and smaller prey such as hares, ground birds, and warthogs. Females prefer a solitary life unless it is mating season, and males prefer to live in groups of two to four, called "coalitions." The female gives birth to one to eight cubs after a gestation period of 90 to 95 days. The cubs depend on the mother for about three months and are very vulnerable to predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
        <p>The cheetah is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for their spotted pelt. They are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their livestock. This species is protected by the law, and the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums is dedicated to the research of breeding the species for preservation.</p></span>

        <img id="numbat" src="img/numbat.jpg" alt="numbat" /><span class="numbat-info"><h2>Numbat Population: 50</h2><p>The numbat is a marsupial and is also called the banded anteater. This animal is unique because it belongs to its own family, and unlike many other marsupials it is mainly active in the day instead of night. The numbat has a reddish-brown coat with white stripes on its back. There is a dark bar that crosses its eye from its ear to its snout. It has a long head and bushy tail.</p>
        <p>Numbats eat termites requiring them to dig in termite holes using their sharp claws and long sticky tongues and eating them whole. They are mainly solitary except when it is time to mate or when the females care for their young. Numbats make their own shelters by digging and nesting leaves, bark and grass in hollow logs. Numbat females do not have pouches so the young must cling to the front of the female and the surround hair. The young are fed at night and are often moved between nests mounted on the mothers back.</p>
        <p>Numbats were once widely distributed throughout southern Australia, but are now only found in Western Australia, and the estimated population is around 2000. Their numbers have decreased mainly because of the introduction of the red fox and loss of habitat.</p></span>

        <img id="panda" src="img/panda.jpg" alt="panda" /><span class="panda-info"><h2>Giant Panda Population: 1864</h2><p>The giant panda is an extremely rare animal found mainly in the Western Szechwan province of southwest China. The giant panda can weigh from 165 to 330 lb. The head and body of the panda is mainly white with the exception of its ears, eye patches, nose, shoulders, arms, and legs. The giant pandas eyes are very small and its vision is poor. Enlarged bones in its wrists allow it to grip bamboo stems. They have very strong jaws and large molar teeth that are used to crush the tough bamboo stems. Pandas are very good climbers and use their skill to escape predators. They are also able to move quickly and silently allowing them to evade predators through tunnels of bamboo.</p>
        <p>Giant pandas eat mostly bamboo leaves and shoots. But they can also eat fruit and berries, fungi, grass, and even small mammals, birds and fish. Pandas live alone most of their lives, only coming together when it is time to mate. Females give birth to cubs that are hairless and blind and weigh only 100g. Cubs depend on their mothers for about 18 months, and then it is time to find and establish its own territory. They use their scent glands beneath their tails for marking territory.</p>
        <p>The giant panda is only found in central and western China, and only 1000 to 2000 remain in the wild. Causes of their decline include destruction of habitat and poaching. And the panda is heavily dependent upon its main food source, bamboo, which is becoming rare in its habitat. In an effort to save this species, the World Wildlife Fund and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry have developed a conservation management plan outlining 14 new panda reserves and five corridors connecting patches of panda habitat. This species is also legally protected to prevent poaching</p></span>

        <img id="porcupine" src="img/porcupine.jpg" alt="porcupine" /><span class="porcupine-info"><h2>Thin Spined Porcupine Population: 1000</h2><p>The thin-spined porcupine is only found in northern and central Brazil. Porcupines are tree-dwelling members of the rodent family. They are stocky animals with blunt muzzles and small eyes, and they are distinguishable by the sharp quills or spines that cover much of their bodies and tails. This species is also called the bristle-spined porcupine because of the more bristle-like spines appearing on the back that no other porcupine species possess. Its coloration is brown and sometimes gray. Adults weigh about 45 ounces on average and grow up to 16.5 inches long. The tail is long and scaly and has no spines. Porcupines usually have a prehensile tail, meaning they are able to use it for climbing, but the tail of the thin-spined porcupine is not prehensile.<p>
        <p>Thin-spined porcupines prefer to live in the trees of dense vegetated forests and bush regions around savannas and cultivated areas. They are slow movers, but are able to jump and climb quickly in the trees if needed. During the day they sleep in hollow tree trunks, nests, or ground holes under rocks. This species generally prefers to live in areas where cocoa trees are present. The cocoa trees provide nuts which are one of their favorite food items. This species also feeds on seeds and fruits. Little is known of the reproductive biology of porcupines. Breeding for this species may occur only one month out of each year, and females tend to choose larger males to mate with.</p>
        <p>This species was once thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 1986. These porcupines are very rarely seen and restricted to remnant forests and forest edges of its range. Its habitat is dwindling very fast due to deforestation and agricultural development. In 1970, this species was listed as endangered, but very few additional conservation measures have been taken to preserve the species.</p></span>

        <img id="sealion" src="img/sealion.jpg" alt="sealion" /><span class="sealion-info"><h2>Steller Sealion Population: 3000</h2><p>The Steller sea-lion is the largest of all seals and sea-lions. Adults males can reach up to 10.5 feet in length and weigh over 2400 lb, and they have large, muscular necks and shoulders. They also have long coarse hair which resembles the mane of African and Asian lions, giving them their name. Females are much smaller than males and can reach up to 9.5 feet and weigh over 750 lb. They have long flippers, and their coats are tan to reddish-brown in color with darker underparts. When underwater, their coats appear darker. Males can live up to 20 years, and females live ten years longer.</p>
        <p>Steller sea-lions are both land and sea creatures, and they prefer colder waters. When not in the water, adults can mostly be found on rock shelves, ledges and sand beaches where they gather to breed and give birth. When ready to rest, sunbathe, or take refuge, they travel to nearby haulout sites where they may remain throughout the year. These haulouts and rookeries are usually found on remote islands where access by predators is limited. Steller sea-lions eat a wide variety of marine life, such as pollock, flounder, salmon, squid, and other small seal species, and they prefer to feed at night. Food is caught by diving into the ocean, and the deepest dive by a sea-lion is recorded as 480 feet.</p>
        <p>Breeding occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Dominant males arrive early to the rookeries to establish territory. Females arrive about a week later and mate with whatever male controls the territory that they choose to breed in. Males will mate with 3 to 20 females total. Females give birth to only one pup after a gestation period of 11.5 months, and the pups remain with the mother for several years.</p>
        <p>Steller sea-lion numbers have declined because of accidental capture in fishnets, loss of food source to fishermen, and hunting. Some are shot each year by fishermen who consider them competition or pests to the fishing industry. This species is now legally protected by the United States, and intentional killing of any Steller sea-lion is prohibited</p></span>

        <img id="snowleopard" src="img/snowleopard.jpg" alt="snowleopard" /><span class="snowleopard-info"><h2>Snow Leopard Population: 4000</h2><p>The snow leopard is found in the mountain ranges of Central Asia stretching from northwestern China to Tibet and the Himalayas. Adults can grow up to four feet in length and can weigh from 60 to 120 lbs. The fur of the snow leopard is spotted and varies in color from white or cream to pale yellow or gray. Its tail is thickly furred and can grow as long as the leopards body. Snow leopards are muscular and agile enabling them to leap up to 50 feet horizontally and 20 feet vertically.</p>
        <p>The snow leopard prefers mountain steppes and coniferous forest scrub as its habitat at altitudes from 2000 to 6000 meters. In the summer, snow leopards travel to alpine meadows and rocky areas, and in the winter they travel to lower forest area to find prey. Diet consists of boars, arkhar, markhor, bharal, ibex, marmots, and other small rodents. Snow leopards appear to be solitary creatures, except during the breeding season. Mating occurs in late winter and early spring. The female gives birth to two or three cubs after a gestation period of 100 days.</p>
        <p>Snow leopards were once heavily hunted for their pelts which sold for a very high price in the fur market. Also, their bones and other body parts are valued in traditional Asian medicine. Loss of habitat, persecution, and competition with humans for prey also threaten the species. Snow leopards do well in captivity, and conservation efforts have helped some, bringing the current population to 6000 (up from 1000 in the 1960s).</p></span>

        <img id="whale" src="img/whale.jpg" alt="whale" /><span class="whale-info"><h2>Blue Whale Population: 10000</h2><p>The blue whale is the largest of all whales and is said to be the largest animal in Earths history. The average length of an adult blue whale is 79 to 88 feet and the average weight is 130 to 150 tons. Blue whales are blue to blue-gray and may sometimes appear to have a faint yellow skin color because of the many microorganisms that accumulate on their bodies as they travel through colder waters. Blue whales prefer cold waters and open seas and prefer not to venture near coastal areas. However, some whales have been seen off the coast of Peru.</p>
        <p>The blue whale eats mostly krill (small shrimp-like crustaceans) by using its baleen plates lining its mouth to sieve krill from the water. It can consume several tons of krill daily. Researchers have believed that the blue whale only eats in the summer, seldom eating during the rest of the year. But recent research has suggested that some blue whales of the north may eat year-round and that blue whales found traveling with empty stomachs may stop eating during migration and resume feeding at wintering areas. Blue whales only mate in warmer waters and the gestation period lasts 10 to 11 months. The females give birth to only one calf in the spring which gives the calf the entire summer to grow a layer of blubber needed to protect it when traveling through colder waters. The calves nurse for around seven months.</p>
        <p>There are three subspecies of blue whales. The blue whales of the northern and southern hemispheres generally come together for mating, but they are considered two separate subspecies, Balaenoptera musculus musculus and Balaenoptera musculus intermedia. The third subspecies, the pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda), is smaller than the others, and it is found in the sub-Antarctic waters of the Indian Ocean and the southeast Atlantic Ocean. Over 350,000 whales have been hunted and killed, and by the 1960s, blue whales were on the edge of extinction. There are probably only around 2500 blue whales left in the oceans and they are now legally protected despite opposition by the whaling industry.</p></span>

        <img id="wolf" src="img/wolf.jpg" alt="wolf" /><span class="wolf-info"><h2>Grey Wolf Population: 70</h2><p>The gray wolf is the largest of the canines and can reach a weight of 80 lb and 5 to 6.5 feet in length. It can live for up to 13 years. In the eastern woodlands, the gray wolf is also known as the "timber wolf," and in the arctic, the gray wolf is sometimes called the "arctic wolf." In the tundra, the gray wolf is sometimes called the "tundra wolf." The gray wolf has a gray fur coat with long tawny-colored legs, a narrow chest, and tawny-colored flanks. Males are larger than females. The gray wolf can reach up to 45 mph in a short sprint but can also run up to 25 mph for several miles. They have an excellent sense of smell and hearing.<p>
        <p>The gray wolf is an excellent hunter seeking animals and preying on them using their scent. When in packs they can seek large prey, such as moose, elk, bison, or deer. When alone they hunt smaller animals such as hare or beavers. Wolves can travel up to 30 miles a day searching for prey. Wolves are also known for their howling. Wolves howl for several reasons. Howling helps members of the pack keep in touch and to communicate in thick forest area or over great distances. Howling also helps to summon pack members to specific locations, declaration of territory, or claiming of fresh kills.</p>
        <p>Wolf packs consists of two parents, their offspring, and a few other non-breeding adults. Females give birth to five or six pups that depend totally on their mother's milk for seven months. After the seven months, they begin hunting with the adult wolves. The pups may remain with the pack for up three years, later leaving to search for their own life-long mates and to try and develop their own packs.</p>
        <p>There are an estimated 7000 to 9000 wolves in Alaska and more than 3500 in the lower 48 states. In earlier times there were over 2 million in 57 countries, but now there are only an estimated 200,000. In the 1970s the gray wolf was placed on the endangered species list. The main threat to the survival of the gray wolf was mainly due the hunting and trapping of the wolf because it was thought of as a nuisance and habitat loss due to human encroachment into wolf territories. The gray wolf population was almost completely wiped out, but the gray wolf is now legally protected and is said to be thriving and may even be taken off the endangered species list.</p></span>
